//---The main page---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.main.title = Kerbal Planetary Base Systems
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.main.subtitle = Building bases on other planets has never been easier.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.main.desc = Honestly, this is still hard sometimes. Therefore, you will find all the information you need to build a base here.

//---Deployable Parts---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.title = Deployable Parts
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.subtitle = Some parts of the mod can be deployed and retracted.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.desc = The deployable parts are retracted at start but can be deployed in the VAB/SHP or on the active vessel. When retracted, these part cannot hold any crew!
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.deploy = Deploy
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.retract = Retract
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.header = Following three parts can be deployed:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.hab = Habitat MK2:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.hab.desc = The Habitat MK2 can hold 4 Kerbals when deployed.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.greenhouse = Greenhouse:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.greenhouse.desc = The greenhouse can hold 2 Kerbals when deployed.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.laboratory = Laboratory:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.deploy.parts.laboratory.desc = Like the greenhouse, the laborytory can hold 2 Kerbals when deployed.

//---Landing legs---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.title = Landing-Legs and Wheels
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.subtitle = Sometimes your bases just have to stay down to earth.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.legs = Landing Legs:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.legs.bigfood = "Bigfoot" Low Profile Landing-Leg
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.legs.bigfood.desc = The "Bigfoot" can be attached at the sides of parts or at docking nodes. Press <b>ALT<b> to attachment them easier on nodes
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.legs.littlefood = "Little Bigfoot" Underside Landing-Leg
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.legs.littlefood.desc = The "Little Bigfoot" can be attached underneath the base parts. Very useful when not enough space is available
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.wheels = Attachable Wheel:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.legs.wheels.desc = The attachable landing gear can be used to drive to your base when you landed off course. It best fits on the "Bigfoot" Landing leg. The landing gear can be retracted or even decoupled when no longer needed.

//---Storage---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.title = Storage System
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.subtitle = For all your storage needs
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.desc = KPBS provides a modular storage system in multiple form factors.The system consists of storage racks and containers:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.racks = Storage Racks:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.racks.desc = There are three sizes for the base-profile racks with 2, 4 and 6 slots for containers and two sizes for the 2.5m diamater rockets with 4 and 8 slots.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.container = Containers:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.container.desc = There are two sizes of containers. The small ones take up one slot in a rack, the big containers take up two slots.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.attach = Attaching the containers:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.attach.desc = To attach a container to a rack, simply use the provided attach nodes. You can also attach and detach the containes with KIS.

//---Config---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.title = Configuration
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.subtitle = You can configure which categories are added to the editor for this mod. This can be done in the <b>GameData/PlanetaryBaseInc/KPBS_config.cfg</b> configuration file.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.subcategory = Own Subcategory:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.subcategory.desc = Available when <b>showModCategory</b> is <b>true</b>. This option adds a new Sub- Category to the Filter. The parts in this Subcategory are separated by their function.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.lifesupport = Filter for Life Support:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.lifesupport.desc = By default KPBS ships with the Community Category Kit that puts all parts for life support into one category.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.functionfilter = Category in Function-Filter:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.config.functionfilter.desc = Available when the <b>"Group all Parts in Function Filter"</b> setting is enabled in the difficulty settings of each game. This option adds a category to the function filter. All parts of KPBS are listed here now.

//---Getting into space---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.title = Getting into Space
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.subtitle = Before you can create a base an another planet, you have to get the parts into space first.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.parts = KPBS has three parts that allow you to put the base parts on top of the rocket. The first one can be put on a 2.5m rocket and has two slots, the second one has three slots and can ba put on a 3.75m rocket. The third part is the adapter for a base part to the 1.25m rockets.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.setup1 = On the right is an example of some base parts on top of a 2.5m rocket. The middle of the couplers have an additonal attachment point for beams or parts that should be on the top of the base parts, like parachutes or airbreaks.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.setup1 = For best performance it is advised to put a protective shell around them.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.bicoupler = Bi-Coupler with two slots
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.storage.tricoupler = Tri-Coupler with three slots

//---Reentry and Landing---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.title = Reentry and Landing
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.subtitle = Once in space it can only go down
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.desc = For the reentry into an atmosphere the following configuration proves to be the most reliable:
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.parachute = Parachute
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.airbrake = Airbrakes
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.wheels = Wheels and Legs
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.heatshield = Heatshield
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.control = Control Unit
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.separator = Stack separator
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.text1 = The shield protects you from the heat while the airbreaks slow the craft down and keep it stable. When safe, deploy the big parachute.\n You can then separate both sides and land them safely with the landing engines and parachutes.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.text2 = Keep in mind that you need a control unit on each vessel!
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.landing.title = Landing without atmosphere
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.landing.text1 = When there is no atmosphre use a bigger engine in place if the heatshield to slow down. The Meerkat landing engine will help you to land the craft safely. On planets with higher gravity a skycrane can be of help.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.reentry.landing.text2 = You also might want to separate both sites in orbit and land them separately.

//---Corridors---
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.title = Corridors
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.subtitle = Dynamic parts to connect your base
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.desc = With KPBS comes a variety of corridor parts that you can use to connect your base or also build space- stations. The corridor parts have a special feature:\n They adapt their appearance to where you have connected other parts to them. This means that you only need one corridor part to build everything. 
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.connect = Once connected, the corridor changes it appearance. It can have all kind of shapes: straight corridor, corner, crossway, T-shape. This behaviour is also present when connecting parts via KIS. So you can create your base directly at the planet without having to puzzle over every detail.
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.base = There is also an adapting part with the profile of the base parts of you'd more like the base to look like one single piece. 
#LOC_KPBS.kspedia.corridors.note = Note: When you have KAS installed there is also a flexible corridor available.
